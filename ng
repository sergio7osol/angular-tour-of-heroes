USING YARN FOR ANGULAR CLI:
    yarn --version    // 0.19.x at least to avoid issues with global packages
    yarn global bin    // Then you need to ensure that the folder where Yarn writes the global packages executable files.
    yarn global add @angular/cli    // get Angular CLI
    ng new test-project --skip-install    // When you create a new project, the CLI goes and runs npm install for you by default. You can tell it not to by passing a --skip-install flag (-si for short)
        But then youâ€™ll have to go run Yarn yourself
            cd test-project
            yarn
    ng set --global packageManager=yarn    // tell the CLI to use Yarn instead of NPM


WORKING WITH PROJECT 
    npm start or ng serve    // start angular - to get going with the project
        [--open (-o)]  // option will automatically open your browser on http://localhost:4200/    
    ng generate component heroes    // generate a new component named "heroes"
